#  Restaurant – Machine Learning Internship Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the machine learning tasks completed as part of my internship at **Cognifyz Technologies**. The project focuses on analyzing a restaurant dataset and building predictive and analytical models using Python and popular machine learning libraries.

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes information about restaurants such as:
- Restaurant name
- City and location (latitude & longitude)
- Cuisines
- Price range and average cost
- Customer votes and ratings
- Online delivery and table booking availability

---

## 🧠 Tasks Completed

### ✅ Task 1: Restaurant Rating Prediction
- Built regression models to predict restaurant aggregate ratings.
- Performed data preprocessing, feature encoding, and model evaluation.
- Improved the task by categorizing ratings into quality levels (Poor, Average, Good, Excellent).



### ✅ Task 2: Restaurant Recommendation System
- Developed a content-based recommendation system.
- Recommended similar restaurants based on cuisine, city, and price range.
- Used cosine similarity for measuring similarity between restaurants.



### ✅ Task 3: Cuisine Classification
- Built a classification model to predict restaurant cuisine types.
- Handled categorical encoding and class imbalance.
- Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.



### ✅ Task 4: Location-based Analysis
- Performed geographical analysis using latitude and longitude.
- Visualized restaurant distribution across locations.
- Analyzed city-wise restaurant concentration, ratings, and pricing patterns.



## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Folium (for maps)
- Kaggle Notebook



## 📌 Key Learnings
